A simple Python Employee Management App connected to a MySQL database using CRUD helps manage employee records in a company.

It allows to:
- Add new employees
- View all employees
- Update employee details (like name, department, or salary)
- Delete employees"

I used the same to build Django built-in web app designed with HTML and Bootstrap to manage employees records.
